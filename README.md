# Selfelected1337 - the first non fix font for programming

The first programming font that is _not_ a fix font.  
We don't program like we did in the 1980s; it is time to update the font too.

It is based on [Arimo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Arimo) which has the same metrics as Arial.  
[Arial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arial) is an easy-to-read font but typical programming characters don't stand out.

## Form follows function.  
In C-syntax-like languages the Very Important and Very Impactful operator Not is as small exclamation sign. That is not functional.
Alas the exclamation sign is fatter than normal.

Parentheses and curly braces stand out, higher than normal and has an extra space around them.  

In javascript/HTML land the quote and double quote is used a lot.  
Alas they look different from each other.

Digits all have the same width.  
Zero looks different from lower case L and, to make it even clearer, has a small dot in it.

## OTF
Grab the lates release [here](https://github.com/LosManos/Font-Selfelected1337/releases).
Download the `otf` file, open it (should default to (Windows) default font viewer), and choose to install. It is a font, nothing else.

Due to a bug? in Visual Studio 2019?; Visual studio cannot load a newly installed font but has to be restared first.
